# Package Style

This portion of the model is optimized to support organization design, more or less from scratch.
I am expecting a graph/tree structure with some standard rules.

I am also expecting the structure to be wrong most of the time.
Departments are added, but responsibilities are not clear.
Roles can be added, but maybe the corresponding positions are still vacant and so on.
It takes time to build an organization, so `incomplete` is a valid state. 

Rules are captured in specifications. They allow to display which rules are violated, but they can also be blockers when trying to promote an organization to a more reliable stage.
